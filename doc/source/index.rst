    TBmodels is a Python package for evaluating tight-binding models. It features methods for reading and writing tight-binding models to various formats, and evaluating the Hamiltonian and eigenvalues of the system. It is considerably faster than comparable packages, enabling it to handle first-principles derived tight-binding models.
